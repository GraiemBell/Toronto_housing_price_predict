# Toronto Housing Price Prediction #

This project is probably one of the best things I have done this summer as it made me read and research things that I otherwise would not. Hours and hours spent deciding how to approach it, getting the data, plotting the most beautiful geomaps of the city I live in, preprocessing, deciding what models to use and, of course, parameters’ tuning. Being stuck in one of these topics and trying to sort things out sometimes takes days to finish, yet gives me great satisfaction when I see the work done.

Why I chose this topic? About two years ago, in 2016, I was working in a bank as an Underwriter and had to work with tons of housing data, Investment loans, RRSPs, TFSAs. Many applications go through your hands and you learn things quickly, but it also involves lots of manual work, banking is probably the most conservative field out there so seeing something state of the art in your office is an unusual luxury. Whereas it Tech world it takes weeks/months to implement a new idea, In Banking you might never see it yourself, hope my kids will!

Ontario housing market has been surprising and keeping my attention for quite a while. I was curious how predicting housing prices work without manual human involvement, how different areas compare to each other in terms of value, price, people who live in there etc… Many questions remained unanswered even after leaving the bank last year. After a little bit of the thinking, I started wondering: Why wouldn’t I write my own project? I did not take much of a data when I left so I had nothing on hands to work with. Bless government of Canada that made local real estate companies disclose housing sales to public, finally something to work with. This year I also went to a coding school to study Data Science, that definitely helped, but even after 3 months of school I didn’t learn as many things as I did by myself spending my Friday nights in happy solitude.
###What questions I wanted to answer?###
- Where and how to get the dataset?
- How to feature engineer my own predictors coming from different sources?
- Determine the most expensive areas of the city?
- How to select the right model?
- What is the best approach to hyperparameter optimization?

###Things you might find interesting in this paper:###
