# Toronto Housing Price Prediction # 

The volume of preliminary work this project required amounted to perhaps one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences I’ve had this summer. Through countless iterations on approach, fetching data, and finalizing model selection to plotting beautiful geomaps, preprocessing, and finally parameters’ tuning, each step produced a POC-like hurdle that took time to overcome but ultimately led to fruitful professional development. Surprisingly, although helpful, a three month data science course I took earlier this year paled in comparison to the growth I experienced spending my Friday nights working on this project in happy solitude.

The deciding factor in terms of subject matter comes from an experience I had last year as a Credit Risk Analyst at a bank. As expected, the role required processing many TFSA, RRSP, investment loan as well as housing applications. It piqued my curiosity into the Ontario housing market, particularly price prediction without manual human involvement. Many questions such as how different areas compare to each other in terms of value, price, demographic distribution, etc, remained unanswered even upon my departure from finance this past year. Since banking institutions have difficulty completely transitioning from their analog/manual past, it ensures working with new, efficient technology an unusual luxury. With my current skillset, I figured I had the tools to attempt a solution.


> Special note: The project was based on the real data that came from the bank's database. In order to avoid any confidentiality issues I have decided to recreate the project and use the similar techniques I used there but with the publicly available data. I took advantage of the Canadian government’s enforcement towards real estate companies to disclose their housing sales to the public.
